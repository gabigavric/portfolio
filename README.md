**Portfolio**

Gabrijela Gavric

*Objective*

My goal was to create a site to display my progress throughout my time at Epicodus.<br>
I intend to do so by including a section about me and a seperate page of my <br>
projects. Each project will have a title, a screen shot of the landing page, a <br>
descripton and a link to the website.

*Setup*

Copy this into your terminal :
<ul>
  <li>git clone "https://github.com/gabigavric/portfolio.git"</li>
  <li>cd "portfolio"</li>
  <li>bundle install</li>
  <li>rails db:schema:load</li>
  <li>rails s</li>
<ul>
<br>
Then type "localhost:3000" into the url of your web browser.

*Bugs*

This is a work-in-progress, therefore it may not be deployable or functioning at <br>
times. Feel free to send me an email for inquiries or suggestions to <br>
gabigavric@gmail.com.
